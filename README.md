## Description

I've been tasked with making a command-line application that allows the user to;

- add departments/roles/employees
- remove departments/roles/employees
- update departments/roles/employees

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:Cratesy/employee-tracker.git
cd employee-tracker
npm install
```

## Usage

As a user, when we run the app. we are presented with a list of tasks which we can click to add, remove, update and also view all of the db items.
